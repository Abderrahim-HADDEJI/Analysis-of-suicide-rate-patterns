# Analysis-of-suicide-rate-patterns

Suicide rates have exploded over recent decades. There are a number of reasons that can contribute to these suicides as part of this project.
In this case, we will attempt to understand the parameters that contribute to suicide and try to predict the suicide rate using our machine learning algorithms.
We will conduct an exploratory analysis of the data to understand the problem's parameters and the outcome of this suicide.
The stages of this project consist of:
- Importing the Libraries
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Plotting some important data visualisation using Seaborn
- Fill in some missing values
- Convert strings to categories
- Transform categorical variables into numbers
- Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
- Feature Scaling 
- Modeling using (Random Forest Regressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, LinearRegression, Support Vector Machine)

So the parameters of this dataset are country, your sex, age, number of suicides, population,
country year hits day of for his day, four year GDP for the year and GDP per capita and generation.
